| | Old Way | New System |
|---|---|---|
| 🖥️ **Access** | One computer only | Any browser, any device |
| 📍 **Tracking** | Manual follow-ups | Real-time status updates |
| 🔍 **Verification** | Phone calls / emails | Scan a QR code instantly |
| 📝 **Record-Keeping** | Prone to data loss | Automatic, permanent logs |

> **Goal:** Make sending, receiving, and tracking documents across DTI Region VI faster, more reliable, and fully traceable.
